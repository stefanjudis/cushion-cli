cli-prompt
==========

A tiny CLI prompter

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/carlos8f/node-cli-prompt.png)](http://travis-ci.org/carlos8f/node-cli-prompt)

Install
-------

```javascript
$ npm install --save cli-prompt
```

Usage
-----

Exports a single function:

### `prompt(message, handler)`

- `message`: text prompt for the user
- `handler`: called with the user's entered text (before return key is pressed),
  and an `end` function which pauses `stdin`, so process won't hang open.

Example
-------

```
var prompt = require('cli-prompt');

prompt('enter your first name: ', function (val) {
  var first = val;
  prompt('and your last name: ', function (val, end) {
    console.log('hi, ' + first + ' ' + val + '!');
    end();
  });
});
```
